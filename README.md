## Briefly about the project

This application intends to help any CodeCool student at any level who wants to learn the theoretical curriculum.
Only the learning mode is available currently from the game modes. This mode picks up random questions from the back-end and shows it. The user can decide if he/she wants to repeat the question later or not.

The question managing section is also available from UI through the 'Question Management' button (**admin rights are necessary**).

## Config & Install

You need to install the **REACT JS** and set the IDEA to start the project with `npm start` command or type it manually every app launch.
To run the app in the development mode, please open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload automatically if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Important information

The main purpose of this project is improving my REACT knowledge therefore it doesn't contain the best practices and patterns.
For instance: You can find a **button** component in the app which is totally useless because it can't do more than a classic HTML button, it's just fun. :)

**There is no registration feature on the page**, so please use one of these accounts:

`Admin / password` or `User / password`

## Future plans

Registration, Filter function for better searching, Answer rating, Quiz Mode which helps mentors during the exam, and summarizing page.
